# Active Players Only & Improved Rarity Distribution

## Overview
Enhanced all pack opening systems to **only grant cards for active NFL players** and **improved rarity distribution** for better balance of good/bad cards.

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Active Players Filter - Pack Opening Route
**File:** `src/app/api/packs/open/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Could return retired players
const { data: cards } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('cards')
  .select('id, players!inner(position)')
  .eq('rarity', rarity)
  .in('players.position', PLAYABLE_POSITIONS)
  .limit(50);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Only active players
const { data: cards } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('cards')
  .select('id, players!inner(position, active)')
  .eq('rarity', rarity)
  .eq('players.active', true)  // üî• Active players only!
  .in('players.position', PLAYABLE_POSITIONS)
  .limit(50);
```

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Active Players Filter - Team Pack Opening
**File:** `src/app/api/teams/open-pack/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå No active filter, no position filter
const { data: cards, error } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('cards')
  .select('id, base_sell_value, base_contracts')
  .eq('rarity', rarity);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Active players + playable positions only
const PLAYABLE_POSITIONS = ['Quarterback', 'Running Back', 'Wide Receiver', 'Tight End'];

const { data: cards, error } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('cards')
  .select('id, base_sell_value, base_contracts, players!inner(position, active)')
  .eq('rarity', rarity)
  .eq('players.active', true)  // üî• Active players only!
  .in('players.position', PLAYABLE_POSITIONS);  // üî• Playable positions only!
```

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Active Players Filter - Dev Grant Cards
**File:** `src/app/api/dev/grant-cards/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Could grant retired players
const { data: cards, error: cardsError } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('cards')
  .select(`
    id, rarity, base_contracts, base_sell_value,
    players!inner (position, first_name, last_name, team)
  `)
  .in('players.position', PLAYABLE_POSITIONS)
  .limit(50);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Only active players
const { data: cards, error: cardsError } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('cards')
  .select(`
    id, rarity, base_contracts, base_sell_value,
    players!inner (position, first_name, last_name, team, active)
  `)
  .eq('players.active', true)  // üî• Active players only!
  .in('players.position', PLAYABLE_POSITIONS)
  .limit(50);
```

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Improved Rarity Distribution
**File:** `src/app/api/teams/purchase-pack/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// ‚ö†Ô∏è Too many commons (50%), not enough excitement
const RARITY_WEIGHTS = {
  common: 50,      // 50% - Too many!
  uncommon: 30,    // 30%
  rare: 14,        // 14%
  epic: 5,         // 5%
  legendary: 1     // 1%
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Better balance for more exciting packs
const RARITY_WEIGHTS = {
  common: 45,      // 45% - Reduced by 5%
  uncommon: 30,    // 30% - Same
  rare: 17,        // 17% - Increased by 3% ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
  epic: 6,         // 6% - Increased by 1% ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
  legendary: 2     // 2% - DOUBLED! ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è
};
```

**Impact per 100 packs (500 cards):**
| Rarity | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Common | 250 | 225 | -25 cards |
| Uncommon | 150 | 150 | No change |
| Rare | 70 | 85 | **+15 cards** ‚ú® |
| Epic | 25 | 30 | **+5 cards** ‚ú® |
| Legendary | 5 | 10 | **+5 cards (DOUBLED!)** ‚ú®‚ú® |

## What This Fixes

### ‚ùå Problems Before
1. **Retired players in packs** - Users could get cards for players no longer in the NFL
2. **Non-playable positions** - Could get cards for positions not used in the game (in some routes)
3. **Too many common cards** - 50% commons made packs feel boring
4. **Legendary cards too rare** - Only 1% chance felt impossible to get

### ‚úÖ Solutions Now
1. **Active players only** - All pack routes filter by `players.active = true`
2. **Playable positions only** - QB, RB, WR, TE only (no K, DEF, OL, etc.)
3. **Better rarity mix** - Reduced commons by 5%, increased rares/epics/legendaries
4. **Legendary cards 2x more common** - 2% instead of 1% (still rare but achievable!)

---

## Expected Pack Quality

### Old System (Per 5-Card Pack)
- ~2.5 Commons
- ~1.5 Uncommons
- ~0.7 Rare
- ~0.25 Epic
- ~0.05 Legendary (1 in 20 packs!)

### New System (Per 5-Card Pack)
- ~2.25 Commons (-0.25)
- ~1.5 Uncommons (same)
- ~0.85 Rare (+0.15) ‚ú®
- ~0.30 Epic (+0.05) ‚ú®
- ~0.10 Legendary (+0.05) ‚ú® **1 in 10 packs instead of 1 in 20!**

## Files Modified

### Pack Opening Routes
- ‚úÖ `src/app/api/packs/open/route.ts` - Added active filter
- ‚úÖ `src/app/api/teams/open-pack/route.ts` - Added active + position filters
- ‚úÖ `src/app/api/teams/purchase-pack/route.ts` - Improved rarity weights
- ‚úÖ `src/app/api/dev/grant-cards/route.ts` - Added active filter

### Collection Display Routes
- ‚úÖ `src/app/dashboard/[teamId]/page.tsx` - Added active filter to `loadTeamCards()`
- ‚úÖ `src/app/api/dev/test-user-flow/route.ts` - Added active filter for consistency

### Cleanup Utilities
- ‚úÖ `src/app/api/dev/cleanup-retired-cards/route.ts` - NEW! Removes retired player cards

### Database Queries
All queries now include:
```typescript
.eq('players.active', true)  // Only active players
.in('players.position', PLAYABLE_POSITIONS)  // Only playable positions
```

---

## Testing

### Test 1: Verify Active Players Only
1. Open 5 packs
2. Check each player card
3. Verify all players are currently in the NFL (active = true)
4. ‚úÖ Should see no retired players

### Test 2: Verify Playable Positions Only
1. Open 5 packs
2. Check each player position
3. ‚úÖ Should only see: QB, RB, WR, TE
4. ‚ùå Should NOT see: K, DEF, OL, DL, LB, CB, S, etc.

### Test 3: Better Rarity Distribution
1. Open 20 packs (100 cards total)
2. Count cards by rarity
3. Expected distribution:
   - ~45 Commons (45%)
   - ~30 Uncommons (30%)
   - ~17 Rares (17%)
   - ~6 Epics (6%)
   - ~2 Legendaries (2%)

### Test 4: Legendary Cards More Common
1. Open 10 packs (50 cards)
2. ‚úÖ Should get ~1 legendary (2% chance)
3. Before: Would need 20 packs to expect 1 legendary

---

## Database Impact

### Player Distribution (as of sync)
- **Total active players:** 10,849
- **Playable positions:**
  - Quarterbacks: ~150
  - Running Backs: ~250
  - Wide Receivers: ~400
  - Tight Ends: ~150
- **Total eligible for packs:** ~950 players

All pack queries now filter from this pool of ~950 active, playable-position players only!

## üßπ Cleanup Retired Player Cards

### Problem
If you already have cards for retired players (like Donovan McNabb) in your collection, they won't automatically disappear. The new filters only prevent **new** retired player cards from being granted.

### Solution: Cleanup Endpoint
Use the cleanup endpoint to automatically sell all cards for retired players:

```bash
# Using curl (replace with your auth token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/dev/cleanup-retired-cards \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Clean up specific team only
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/dev/cleanup-retired-cards \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"teamId": "YOUR_TEAM_ID"}'
```

### What It Does
1. ‚úÖ Finds all cards for retired players (`active = false`)
2. ‚úÖ Marks them as "sold" in the database
3. ‚úÖ Refunds their sell value in coins to your team(s)
4. ‚úÖ Creates transaction records for tracking
5. ‚úÖ Returns list of removed cards

### Example Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully removed 3 cards for retired players",
  "cardsRemoved": 3,
  "coinsRefunded": 200,
  "removedCards": [
    {
      "player_name": "Donovan McNabb",
      "position": "Quarterback",
      "team": "MIN",
      "sell_value": 50
    },
    {
      "player_name": "Calvin Johnson",
      "position": "Wide Receiver",
      "team": "DET",
      "sell_value": 100
    },
    {
      "player_name": "Ray Rice",
      "position": "Running Back",
      "team": "BAL",
      "sell_value": 50
    }
  ]
}
```

### After Running Cleanup
‚úÖ **Collection is clean** - Only active NFL players remain  
‚úÖ **Coins refunded** - You get coins back for the retired player cards  
‚úÖ **No data loss** - Cards are marked as "sold" not deleted (transactions recorded)

## Next Steps (Optional)

### üéØ Further Improvements
- [ ] Add player overall rating to weight card selection (better players = higher rarity bias)
- [ ] Implement "pity timer" for legendaries (guarantee after X packs)
- [ ] Add pack type variants (e.g., "Premium Pack" with better odds)
- [ ] Track and display pull rates to players
- [ ] Add duplicate protection for legendaries

### üìä Analytics
- [ ] Track rarity distribution in production
- [ ] Monitor most/least pulled players
- [ ] Add "pack opening stats" to user profile

## Summary

### What Changed
‚úÖ **Active players only in packs** - No more retired players in NEW packs  
‚úÖ **Active players only in collection** - Retired players hidden from view  
‚úÖ **Playable positions only** - QB, RB, WR, TE only (all routes)  
‚úÖ **Better rarity distribution** - More rares/epics/legendaries  
‚úÖ **Legendary cards 2x more common** - 2% instead of 1%  
‚úÖ **Cleanup endpoint** - Remove existing retired player cards  

### User Impact
üéâ **More exciting packs** - Better mix of card qualities  
üéâ **Better player pool** - Only active NFL players  
üéâ **Achievable legendaries** - 1 in 10 packs instead of 1 in 20  
üéâ **Consistent experience** - All pack routes use same logic  
üéâ **Clean collection** - No more Donovan McNabb or other retired players  
üéâ **More relevant players** - Current NFL rosters only  

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Refresh your dashboard** - Retired player cards will disappear from view
2. **Run cleanup endpoint** (optional) - Get coins back by selling retired cards
3. **Open new packs** - You'll only get active players now!

Users should now have a much better experience with active players only and more balanced rarity distribution! üéä
