## 📊 Trending Calculation Logic

### Fantasy Points Formula
```javascript
points = 
  passingYards * 0.04 +    // 1 pt per 25 yards
  passingTDs * 4 +
  interceptions * -2 +
  rushingYards * 0.1 +     // 1 pt per 10 yards
  rushingTDs * 6 +
  receivingYards * 0.1 +   // 1 pt per 10 yards
  receivingTDs * 6 +
  receptions * 0.5 +       // 0.5 PPR
  fumblesLost * -2
```

### Trend Direction Logic
```javascript
if (recentAverage > seasonAverage * 1.15) {
  trending = "up" // 15%+ improvement
} else if (recentAverage < seasonAverage * 0.85) {
  trending = "down" // 15%+ decline
} else {
  trending = "stable"
}
```

### Consistency Score
```javascript
consistencyScore = 100 - (standardDeviation / mean * 100)
// Higher score = more consistent
// Range: 0-100
```

### Boom/Bust Definition
- **Boom Game** - Points > 1.5x season average
- **Bust Game** - Points < 0.5x season average

---

## 🔌 API Integration Points

### Ready for BallDontLie Injury API
The trending system has a placeholder for injury status:

```typescript
// In src/app/api/players/[playerId]/trending/route.ts
async function getInjuryStatus(externalId: string) {
  // TODO: Call BallDontLie injury API
  // mcp_balldontlie-api_nfl_get_player_injuries
  
  return {
    status: 'healthy' | 'questionable' | 'doubtful' | 'out' | 'ir',
    injury: 'Ankle',
    returnDate: '2025-10-15'
  }
}
```

**To integrate:**
```typescript
const injuryResponse = await mcp_balldontlie_api_nfl_get_player_injuries({
  player_ids: [parseInt(externalId)]
});
```
