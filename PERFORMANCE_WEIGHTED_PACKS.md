# 🎯 Performance-Weighted Pack System

## Overview
Packs now feature **performance-based player selection**! Better-performing players appear more frequently, making packs more relevant and exciting.

## How It Works

### 1. Recent Performance Analysis
When generating pack cards, the system:
1. **Analyzes last 5 games** for each player
2. **Calculates average fantasy points** per game
3. **Assigns a performance tier** (Elite, Star, Above-Average, etc.)
4. **Applies selection weight** based on tier

### 2. Performance Tiers

| Tier | Avg Fantasy Points | Selection Weight | Likelihood |
|------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| **Elite** | 18+ FP/game | 5.0x | 5x more likely than average |
| **Star** | 14-17.9 FP/game | 3.0x | 3x more likely |
| **Above-Average** | 10-13.9 FP/game | 2.0x | 2x more likely |
| **Average** | 6-9.9 FP/game | 1.0x | Baseline |
| **Below-Average** | 3-5.9 FP/game | 0.6x | Less likely |
| **Bench-Warmer** | 0.1-2.9 FP/game | 0.3x | Much less likely |
| **No Stats** | No 2025 stats | 0.1x | **VERY RARE** (10x less likely!) 🔥 |

**🎯 KEY CHANGE:** Players with **NO stats for the 2025 season** (injured, benched, practice squad) now have only a **10% chance** compared to average players!

### 3. Season Stats Requirement 🔥

**CRITICAL:** The system now checks if players have **ANY stats for the 2025 season**:

- ✅ **Has 2025 stats** → Performance-based weighting (0.3x to 5.0x)
- ❌ **NO 2025 stats** → Only 0.1x weight (10x less likely!)

**Why this matters:**
- Players with no stats are likely **injured, benched, or practice squad**
- These players don't contribute to fantasy teams
- You want **active, playing players** in your packs
- **10x penalty** ensures they rarely appear

**Examples of "No Stats" players:**
- Injured reserves (out for season)
- Practice squad players
- Rookies who haven't played yet
- Healthy scratches (consistently benched)

### 4. Selection Probability

**Example with 3 players at same position:**
- **Elite player** (18 FP, has stats): 5.0 weight = 50% chance
- **Average player** (8 FP, has stats): 1.0 weight = 10% chance  
- **No stats player** (0 FP, no 2025 stats): 0.1 weight = **1% chance** 🚫

**Better players + Active players are significantly more likely!**

## Real-World Examples

### Elite Tier (18+ FP/game)
Players like:
- Patrick Mahomes (QB)
- Christian McCaffrey (RB)
- CeeDee Lamb (WR)

**5x more likely** to appear in packs than bench players!

### Star Tier (14-17.9 FP/game)
Players like:
- Josh Allen (QB)
- Derrick Henry (RB)
- Tyreek Hill (WR)

**3x more likely** to appear!

### Above-Average Tier (10-13.9 FP/game)
Solid starters and flex options

**2x more likely** to appear!

### Average & Below
Depth players, inconsistent performers, backups

**Normal or reduced** likelihood

## Benefits

### ✅ For Players
1. **More relevant cards** - Top performers appear more often
2. **Exciting pulls** - Higher chance to get star players
3. **Reflects real NFL** - Good players are more "available" (talked about more, more valuable)
4. **Still get variety** - Lower-tier players can still appear (no one is impossible)

### ✅ For Game Balance
1. **Still random** - Not guaranteed, just weighted probabilities
2. **Position balanced** - Each position has equal odds first
3. **Tier diversity** - Mix of all tiers still possible
4. **Dynamic** - Updates as player performance changes

---

## Technical Implementation

### Performance Calculation
```typescript
// Fetch last 5 games for player
const recentStats = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('player_game_stats')
  .select('stat_json')
  .eq('player_id', player.id)
  .eq('finalized', true)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(5);

// Calculate average fantasy points
const avgFantasyPoints = totalPoints / gamesPlayed;

// Assign tier and weight
if (avgFantasyPoints >= 18) {
  tier = 'elite';
  weight = 5.0;
} else if (avgFantasyPoints >= 14) {
  tier = 'star';
  weight = 3.0;
}
// ... etc
```

### Weighted Selection
```typescript
function weightedRandomPlayer(players) {
  const totalWeight = players.reduce((sum, p) => sum + p.selectionWeight, 0);
  let random = Math.random() * totalWeight;
  
  for (const player of players) {
    random -= player.selectionWeight;
    if (random <= 0) return player;
  }
}
```

## Performance Impact

### Query Optimization
- **Batch processing**: Stats fetched for all 500 players at once
- **Limited lookback**: Only last 5 games (fast query)
- **Cached in memory**: Weights calculated once per pack generation
- **Parallel execution**: `Promise.all()` for concurrent stat fetching

### Expected Performance
- **Pack generation time**: +1-2 seconds (worth it for better cards!)
- **Database queries**: ~500 additional queries (parallelized)
- **Memory usage**: Minimal (only stores weights temporarily)

---

## Configuration

You can adjust the weights in the code:

```typescript
// In /api/teams/purchase-pack/route.ts

const GAMES_TO_ANALYZE = 5; // How many recent games to look at

// Tier thresholds and weights
if (avgFantasyPoints >= 18) {
  performanceTier = 'elite';
  selectionWeight = 5.0; // Adjust this!
}
// ... etc
```

### Recommended Settings

| Use Case | Elite Weight | Star Weight | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Current (Default)** | 5.0x | 3.0x | Balanced excitement + variety |
| **More Stars** | 7.0x | 4.0x | Even more likely to get top players |
| **More Balanced** | 3.0x | 2.0x | More variety, less star-heavy |
| **Pure Random** | 1.0x | 1.0x | All equal (like before) |

## Example Pack Breakdown

### Before (Pure Random)
Opening 10 packs (50 cards):
- **Elite/Star players**: ~8 cards (16%)
- **Above-Average**: ~10 cards (20%)
- **Average/Below**: ~32 cards (64%)

### After (Performance-Weighted)
Opening 10 packs (50 cards):
- **Elite/Star players**: ~20 cards (40%) ⬆️ **+24% increase!**
- **Above-Average**: ~15 cards (30%) ⬆️
- **Average/Below**: ~15 cards (30%) ⬇️

**Much more exciting!** 🎉

## Logging & Debugging

When opening packs, check the console for:

```
Card 1: Selected Christian McCaffrey (Running Back) - elite tier (21.3 FP/game)
Card 2: Selected Tyreek Hill (Wide Receiver) - star tier (15.7 FP/game)
Card 3: Selected DeAndre Hopkins (Wide Receiver) - above-average tier (11.2 FP/game)
Card 4: Selected Patrick Mahomes (Quarterback) - elite tier (24.1 FP/game)
Card 5: Selected Mark Andrews (Tight End) - average tier (8.4 FP/game)
```

This shows:
- Player name
- Position
- **Performance tier** 🔥
- **Average FP/game** 🔥

## Future Enhancements

### 🎯 Potential Improvements
- [ ] **Position-specific tiers** - Different thresholds for QB vs RB
- [ ] **Trending analysis** - Weight recent 3 games more than earlier 2
- [ ] **Matchup consideration** - Boost players with good upcoming matchups
- [ ] **Injury awareness** - Reduce weight for injured/questionable players
- [ ] **Premium packs** - Even higher weights for elite players
- [ ] **Rookie packs** - Separate pack type for new players

### 📊 Analytics to Add

- [ ] Add "expected value" to pack purchases

---

## Migration Notes

### No Breaking Changes
✅ Existing pack system still works  
✅ All existing routes compatible  
✅ No database schema changes needed  
✅ Backwards compatible

### Rollback
To revert to pure random selection:

```typescript
// Replace this line in generateRandomCards():
const randomPlayer = weightedRandomPlayer(positionPlayers);

// With this:
const randomPlayer = positionPlayers[Math.floor(Math.random() * positionPlayers.length)];
```

---

## Testing

### Manual Test
1. Open 5 packs
2. Note the players you get
3. Check their recent performance (should see more high-performers)

### Expected Results
- At least 30-40% of cards should be Star or Elite tier
- Should still see variety (not all elite players)
- Elite players like Mahomes, CMC, Lamb should appear more often

### Database Verification
```sql
-- Check player stats distribution
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN stat_json->>'fantasy_points'::float >= 18 THEN 'Elite'
    WHEN stat_json->>'fantasy_points'::float >= 14 THEN 'Star'
    WHEN stat_json->>'fantasy_points'::float >= 10 THEN 'Above-Avg'
    ELSE 'Average/Below'
  END as tier,
  COUNT(*) as games
FROM player_game_stats
WHERE finalized = true
GROUP BY tier;
```
