# Stats Mapping Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Resolved

### Problem Overview
Player statistics from the BallDontLie API were not being correctly mapped to our database, causing inconsistencies between data written during sync operations and data read during display operations.

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Field Name: `receiving_receptions` vs `receptions`**
   - ‚ùå **Before**: Code tried to access `stat.receiving_receptions`
   - ‚úÖ **After**: Correctly uses `stat.receptions` (the actual API field)

2. **Inconsistent Field Naming: `targets` vs `receiving_targets`**
   - ‚ùå **Before**: Game log read `statJson.targets`
   - ‚úÖ **After**: Correctly reads `statJson.receiving_targets`

3. **Missing Fantasy Points Calculation**
   - ‚ùå **Before**: Some sync endpoints didn't calculate fantasy_points
   - ‚úÖ **After**: All sync endpoints now calculate and store fantasy_points

4. **Missing Additional Stats**
   - ‚ùå **Before**: Only storing basic stats
   - ‚úÖ **After**: Now storing QB rating, yards per attempt, sacks, fumbles recovered, etc.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/app/api/admin/sync/stats/route.ts`
**Main stats sync endpoint - most critical fix**

**Changes:**
- Fixed `receiving_receptions` ‚Üí `receptions`
- Added missing passing stats: `yards_per_pass_attempt`, `qb_rating`, `sacks`
- Added missing rushing stats: `yards_per_rush_attempt`
- Added missing receiving stats: `yards_per_reception`
- Added `fumbles_recovered`
- Added comprehensive fantasy points calculation with proper scoring:
  - Passing: 0.04 pts/yd, 4 pts/TD, -2 pts/INT
  - Rushing: 0.1 pts/yd, 6 pts/TD
  - Receiving: 0.1 pts/yd, 6 pts/TD, 1 pt/reception (PPR)
  - Fumbles: -2 pts/lost

### 2. `/src/app/api/players/[playerId]/game-log/route.ts`
**Player game log display - critical for UI**

**Changes:**
- Fixed `statJson.targets` ‚Üí `statJson.receiving_targets`
- Fixed `statJson.receptions` (was incorrectly looking for `receiving_receptions`)
- Fixed `statJson.yards_per_target` ‚Üí `statJson.yards_per_reception`
- Fixed `statJson.yards_per_catch` ‚Üí `statJson.yards_per_reception`

### 3. `/src/app/api/dev/sync-season-data/route.ts`
**Development/testing sync endpoint**

**Changes:**
- Completely restructured to match standardized field mapping
- Added all stat categories (passing, rushing, receiving)
- Added fantasy points calculation
- Added metadata fields
- Now stores full `raw_stats` object for debugging

### 4. `/STATS_FIELD_MAPPING.md` (NEW)
**Comprehensive documentation**

Created a complete reference guide that includes:
- Field-by-field mapping table
- Fantasy points calculation formula
- Common pitfalls and examples
- Testing instructions
- Links to all files using stat mapping

## Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ What's Fixed
1. **Data Integrity**: Stats are now correctly stored in the database
2. **Display Accuracy**: Player game logs will show correct statistics
3. **Fantasy Points**: Proper calculation and storage of fantasy points
4. **Future Development**: Clear documentation prevents regression

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Attention
1. **Existing Data**: Any stats already in the database may have incorrect field names
   - **Recommendation**: Run a fresh sync to replace old data
   - **Command**: `POST /api/admin/sync/stats` with appropriate date range

2. **Database Migration**: Consider running data transformation if historical data is important
   - Can be done via SQL update or re-sync from API

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Verify API Connection
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/dev/test-api -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### 2. Sync Fresh Stats
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/sync/stats \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dates": ["2024-09-08"],
    "season_year": 2024,
    "test_mode": true
  }'
```

### 3. Verify Game Log Display
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/players/[PLAYER_ID]/game-log
```

### 4. Check Fantasy Points
Verify that `fantasy_points` field is populated and calculated correctly in the returned data.

## Fantasy Scoring Reference

### Standard PPR Scoring
| Stat Category | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| Passing Yards | 1 pt per 25 yards (0.04/yard) |
| Passing TD | 4 pts |
| Interception | -2 pts |
| Rushing Yards | 1 pt per 10 yards (0.1/yard) |
| Rushing TD | 6 pts |
| Receiving Yards | 1 pt per 10 yards (0.1/yard) |
| Receiving TD | 6 pts |
| Reception | 1 pt (PPR) |
| Fumble Lost | -2 pts |

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Review the changes in this summary
2. ‚úÖ Read `STATS_FIELD_MAPPING.md` for detailed field reference
3. üîÑ Run a fresh stats sync for current season
4. üîÑ Test game log display in the UI
5. üîÑ Verify fantasy points calculations
6. üìù Consider adding unit tests for stat mapping logic
