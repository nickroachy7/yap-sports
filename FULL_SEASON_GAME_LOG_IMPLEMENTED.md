# Full Season Game Log - Complete Implementation ‚úÖ

## Overview
Updated player stats and game logs to show **ALL games for the season**, including games where the player didn't participate (DNP) and upcoming games for the rest of the season.

## Problem Fixed
**Before**: 
- Game logs only showed games where the player had stats (games they played in)
- No visibility into games where player was inactive/injured
- Upcoming games were not clearly displayed
- Incomplete season overview

**After**:
- ‚úÖ Shows ALL team games for the season
- ‚úÖ Clearly marks DNP (Did Not Play) for completed games without stats
- ‚úÖ Shows all upcoming games for the rest of the season
- ‚úÖ Complete season overview with proper categorization

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Endpoint: `/api/players/[playerId]/quick-data`

**File**: `src/app/api/players/[playerId]/quick-data/route.ts`

#### Key Changes:
1. **Fetch ALL team games** instead of just games with player stats
   ```typescript
   // OLD: Only fetched player_game_stats
   // NEW: Fetch ALL sports_events for the season, then filter by team
   supabaseAdmin
     .from('sports_events')
     .select('id, home_team, away_team, home_team_id, away_team_id, starts_at, status, week_number, week_id')
     .gte('starts_at', `${currentSeasonYear}-08-01`)
     .lte('starts_at', `${currentSeasonYear + 1}-02-28`)
   ```

2. **Map player stats by game ID** for quick lookup
   ```typescript
   const statsByGameId = new Map();
   allStatsRaw.forEach(stat => {
     const gameId = stat.sports_event_id;
     if (gameId) {
       statsByGameId.set(gameId, stat);
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Build complete game log** for ALL team games
   - For games with stats: show actual performance
   - For completed games without stats: mark as DNP (Did Not Play)
   - For upcoming games: show as upcoming with projections

4. **Enhanced summary stats**
   ```json
   {
     "total_games": 18,
     "completed_games": 4,
     "games_played": 3,
     "dnp_games": 1,
     "upcoming_games": 14
   }
   ```

#### Return Data Structure:
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  season: 2025,
  player: {
    // ... player profile
    stats: {
      // Season stats calculated from games actually played
    },
    nextMatchup: {
      // Next upcoming game details
    }
  },
  gameLog: [
    {
      id: string,
      week: number,
      opponent: string,
      date: string,
      time: string,
      projection: number,
      actualPoints: number | undefined,
      isHome: boolean,
      gameStatus: 'upcoming' | 'live' | 'completed',
      playerStats: any | null,
      didNotPlay: boolean  // ‚≠ê NEW field
    }
  ],
  summary: {
    total_games: number,
    completed_games: number,
    games_played: number,  // Excludes DNP
    dnp_games: number,     // ‚≠ê NEW
    upcoming_games: number
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated GameLog Component

**File**: `src/components/ui/GameLog.tsx`

#### Key Changes:
1. **Added `didNotPlay` field** to GameLogEntry interface
   ```typescript
   export interface GameLogEntry {
     // ... existing fields
     didNotPlay?: boolean  // Flag for DNP
   }
   ```

2. **Display "DNP" badge** for games where player didn't play
   ```tsx
   {entry.didNotPlay ? (
     <div className="text-sm font-bold text-yellow-500">
       DNP
     </div>
   ) : (
     <div className="text-sm font-semibold">
       {entry.actualPoints?.toFixed(1) || '-'}
     </div>
   )}
   ```

3. **Updated summary stats** to show 5 categories:
   - **Games Played**: Only counts games with actual stats
   - **DNP**: Count of Did Not Play games (yellow)
   - **Total Points**: Sum of all fantasy points
   - **Avg Per Game**: Average points per game played
   - **Best Game**: Highest scoring game
   - **Upcoming**: Count of future games (blue)

4. **Hide player stats** for DNP entries (shows "-" instead)

### 3. Updated PlayerModal Component

**File**: `src/components/ui/PlayerModal.tsx`

#### Changes:
- Updated cache version to `v5` to force fresh data fetch
- No other changes needed - component automatically handles new fields

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
```
Week 1: @ DEN - 12.5 pts
Week 2: vs LAC - 18.3 pts
Week 3: @ MIN - 15.7 pts
(Missing Week 4 - user doesn't know if there was no game or player didn't play)
```

### After:
```
Week 1: @ DEN - 12.5 pts ‚úÖ
Week 2: vs LAC - 18.3 pts ‚úÖ
Week 3: @ MIN - 15.7 pts ‚úÖ
Week 4: vs KC  - DNP ‚ö†Ô∏è (Game happened, player inactive)
Week 5: @ LV   - [Upcoming] üìÖ
Week 6: vs GB  - [Upcoming] üìÖ
... (all 18 games shown)

Summary:
- Games Played: 3
- DNP: 1
- Total Points: 46.5
- Avg Per Game: 15.5
- Best Game: 18.3
- Upcoming: 14
```

## Technical Details

### Game Status Logic
```typescript
if (game.status === 'final') {
  gameStatus = 'completed';
} else if (game.status === 'live' || game.status === 'in_progress') {
  gameStatus = 'live';
} else if (gameDate < now) {
  gameStatus = 'completed';
}
```

### DNP Detection
```typescript
if (playerStat && playerStat.stat_json) {
  // Player has stats - show actual performance
  actualPoints = calculateFantasyPoints(playerStat.stat_json);
  playerStats = extractPositionStats(playerStat.stat_json);
} else if (gameStatus === 'completed') {
  // Game completed but no stats = DNP
  didNotPlay = true;
  actualPoints = 0;
}
// else: upcoming game, no stats expected
```

### Team Matching Logic
```typescript
const teamGames = allGames.filter(game => {
  const matchesHome = game.home_team === player.team || 
                     (player.team_id && game.home_team_id === player.team_id);
  const matchesAway = game.away_team === player.team || 
                     (player.team_id && game.away_team_id === player.team_id);
  return matchesHome || matchesAway;
});
```
