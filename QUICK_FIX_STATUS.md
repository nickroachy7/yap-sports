# Trending Fixes - Current Status

## ✅ Completed
1. **Icons instead of emojis** - ✅ DONE
   - Using lucide-react `TrendingUp`, `TrendingDown`, `Minus` icons
   - Green, Red, Gray color scheme

2. **Trending Tab UI** - ✅ DONE  
   - Filter toggle buttons (All / Up / Down)
   - Sorted by trend strength
   - Full implementation in players page

3. **Import fix** - ✅ DONE
   - Changed from `createSupabaseServerClient` to `supabaseAdmin`

## ⚠️ In Progress
**Trending Calculation API** - `/api/players/recent-trends`

**Issue**: The endpoint is created but returning 0 players with 3+ games because:
- The game data filtering needs adjustment
- Fantasy points calculation from stat_json needs verification  
- The season-stats endpoint uses a different approach that works

## 🔧 Recommended Next Step

Instead of debugging the new API endpoint further, **use the existing trending endpoint** (`/api/players/[playerId]/trending`) which we know works correctly:

**Current approach that works:**
- `/api/players/[playerId]/trending?season=2025` - ✅ Returns correct data per player
- This endpoint calculates from game stats correctly
- It's what's used in the PlayerModal

**Simpler solution:**
1. Keep the TrendingBadge icon changes ✅
2. Keep the Trending tab UI ✅  
3. Remove `/api/players/recent-trends` endpoint
4. Use the players page to show "-" for all trends initially
5. When user clicks Trending tab, fetch trending data for visible players on-demand
6. OR: Accept that trending shows in modal/profile only (which works now)

## 🎯 What's Working Right Now

**Icons** ✅
- Refresh the page
- You'll see icon components instead of emojis

**Trending Tab UI** ✅
- Click "Trending" tab
- You'll see filter buttons  
- (Just no data yet because API needs fixing)

**Individual Player Trending** ✅
- Open any player modal
- Click "Trending" tab
- Full trending data displays correctly

The individual player trending already works perfectly - it's just the "all players at once" calculation that needs work.
