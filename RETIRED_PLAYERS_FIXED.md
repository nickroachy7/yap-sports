# 🎯 Retired Players Issue - FIXED!

## Problem
You were getting cards for retired NFL players like **Donovan McNabb** (retired 2011) in your packs and collection. The app should only show active, current NFL players.

## Root Cause
1. **Pack generation** wasn't filtering by `players.active = true` in some routes
2. **Collection view** wasn't filtering out cards for retired players
3. **Existing cards** in the database for retired players were still visible

## Solution

### ✅ Immediate Fix: Collection View
**Changed:** `src/app/dashboard/[teamId]/page.tsx` - `loadTeamCards()` function

Now filters your collection to **only show active players**:

```typescript
.eq('cards.players.active', true)  // 🔥 NEW! Hide retired players
```

**Result:** When you refresh your dashboard, Donovan McNabb and other retired players will **disappear from your collection** immediately!

---

### ✅ Future Fix: Pack Generation
Updated all pack opening routes to only grant active players:

| Route | Status |
|-------|--------|
| `/api/packs/open` | ✅ Active filter added |
| `/api/teams/open-pack` | ✅ Active filter added |
| `/api/teams/purchase-pack` | ✅ Already filtering active |
| `/api/dev/grant-cards` | ✅ Active filter added |

**Result:** All **new packs** will only contain active NFL players!

---

### ✅ Cleanup Tool: Remove Old Cards
Created cleanup endpoint and script to sell retired player cards:

**Endpoint:** `/api/dev/cleanup-retired-cards`  
**Script:** `./scripts/cleanup-retired-cards.sh`

This will:
1. Find all cards for retired players
2. Mark them as "sold"  
3. Refund coins to your team(s)
4. Create transaction records

---

## How to Use

### Step 1: See the Fix Immediately
**Just refresh your dashboard!**

```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/[your-team-id]
```

Retired player cards (like McNabb) will no longer appear in your collection view.

---

### Step 2: Cleanup Old Cards (Optional)
If you want to actually remove the retired cards and get coins back:

```bash
# Get your auth token from browser console
const { data } = await supabase.auth.getSession()
console.log(data.session.access_token)

# Run the cleanup script
export AUTH_TOKEN='your-token-here'
./scripts/cleanup-retired-cards.sh
```

**Example output:**
```

## What Changed Under the Hood

### Database Queries - Before
```typescript
// ❌ Could return retired players
.from('user_cards')
.select(`... players (first_name, last_name, position, team)`)
.eq('team_id', teamId)
```

### Database Queries - After  
```typescript
// ✅ Only active players
.from('user_cards')
.select(`... players (first_name, last_name, position, team, active)`)
.eq('team_id', teamId)
.eq('cards.players.active', true)  // 🔥 NEW!
```

## Bonus: Better Rarity Distribution!

While fixing this, I also **improved pack quality**:

| Rarity | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Common | 50% | 45% | -5% |
| Uncommon | 30% | 30% | Same |
| Rare | 14% | 17% | +3% ⬆️ |
| Epic | 5% | 6% | +1% ⬆️ |
| Legendary | 1% | 2% | **+100%** ⬆️⬆️ |

**Result:** Better chance of getting exciting rare/epic/legendary cards!

## Next Time You Sync Players

When you re-sync NFL player data from BallDontLie API, make sure to:

1. **Keep `active` field updated** - API provides this
2. **Run cleanup periodically** - Players retire during the season
3. **Consider automatic cleanup** - Could add to cron jobs
