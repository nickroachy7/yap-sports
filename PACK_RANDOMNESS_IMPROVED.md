# Pack Randomness Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the pack opening system to provide much better randomness and variety in player selection.

## Changes Made

### 1. Random Database Offset
**Problem:** Always fetching the same first 500 players from the database.

**Solution:** Added random offset to query different player pools each time:
```typescript
// Get total count of eligible players
const { count: totalPlayers } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('players')
  .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true })
  .eq('active', true)
  .in('position', PLAYABLE_POSITIONS);

// Use a random offset to get different players each time
const randomOffset = Math.floor(Math.random() * Math.max(0, (totalPlayers || 1000) - 500));

// Query with random window
.range(randomOffset, randomOffset + 499); // Random window of 500 players
```

**Impact:** Each pack can now pull from a different subset of thousands of players!

---

### 2. Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm
**Problem:** `Array.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)` is biased and not truly random.

**Solution:** Implemented proper Fisher-Yates shuffle:
```typescript
function fisherYatesShuffle<T>(array: T[]): T[] {
  const shuffled = [...array];
  for (let i = shuffled.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [shuffled[i], shuffled[j]] = [shuffled[j], shuffled[i]];
  }
  return shuffled;
}

// Usage
const shuffledPlayers = fisherYatesShuffle([...players]);
```

**Impact:** True random distribution of players within each pool.

---

### 3. Improved Rarity Distribution
**Problem:** Too many common cards (60%), not enough variety.

**Solution:** Adjusted weights for more exciting packs:
```typescript
// BEFORE
const RARITY_WEIGHTS = {
  common: 60,      // 60%
  uncommon: 25,    // 25%
  rare: 10,        // 10%
  epic: 4,         // 4%
  legendary: 1     // 1%
};

// AFTER
const RARITY_WEIGHTS = {
  common: 50,      // 50% - Most common
  uncommon: 30,    // 30% - Good chance
  rare: 14,        // 14% - Decent odds
  epic: 5,         // 5% - Exciting find
  legendary: 1     // 1% - Super rare!
};
```

**Impact:** 
- 10% fewer commons
- 20% more uncommons (25% ‚Üí 30%)
- 40% more rares (10% ‚Üí 14%)
- 25% more epics (4% ‚Üí 5%)
- Same legendary rate (1%)

## How It Works Now

### Pack Opening Flow
1. **Count total eligible players** (QB, RB, WR, TE who are active)
2. **Choose random offset** (0 to total_players - 500)
3. **Fetch 500 players** starting from that offset
4. **Group players by position** (QB, RB, WR, TE)
5. **For each card:**
   - Randomly select a position (25% chance each)
   - Randomly select a player from that position
   - Roll rarity using weighted probabilities
6. **Return 5 balanced cards** with variety across positions

### Example
If there are 3,000 eligible players:
- Pack 1 might pull players 0-499
- Pack 2 might pull players 1,234-1,733
- Pack 3 might pull players 2,456-2,955
- Each subset is then shuffled randomly
- Each card gets a random rarity roll

---

## Expected Results

### Position Balance ‚öñÔ∏è
**Equal odds for each position!**
- **Quarterbacks:** 25% chance per card
- **Running Backs:** 25% chance per card
- **Wide Receivers:** 25% chance per card
- **Tight Ends:** 25% chance per card

Each card independently rolls a random position, then selects a random player from that position. This ensures you'll get a balanced mix across all positions over time!

### Rarity Distribution (Per 100 Packs)
**Old weights (per 500 cards):**
- 300 Common
- 125 Uncommon
- 50 Rare
- 20 Epic
- 5 Legendary

**New weights (per 500 cards):**
- 250 Common (-50)
- 150 Uncommon (+25)
- 70 Rare (+20)
- 25 Epic (+5)
- 5 Legendary (same)

## Testing

### Test 1: Player Variety
Buy 5 packs and check if you get different players:
```bash
# You should see wide variety across:
- Different teams
- Different positions
- Star players and depth players
```

### Test 2: Rarity Distribution
Open 20 packs (100 cards total):
```bash
Expected distribution:
- ~50 Common cards
- ~30 Uncommon cards
- ~14 Rare cards
- ~5 Epic cards
- ~1 Legendary card (if lucky!)
```

### Test 3: Position Balance
Each position has equal 25% odds per card:
- **~25% QBs** (1-2 per pack expected)
- **~25% RBs** (1-2 per pack expected)
- **~25% WRs** (1-2 per pack expected)
- **~25% TEs** (1-2 per pack expected)

Over 100 cards (20 packs), you should get approximately 25 of each position!

## Benefits

1. **Much More Variety** - Different players in every pack
2. **Better Rarities** - More uncommons and rares to find
3. **True Randomness** - Fisher-Yates ensures fair distribution
4. **Star Discovery** - Could pull any active NFL player!
5. **Collection Building** - Less duplicate players

## Technical Details

### Fisher-Yates Algorithm
The Fisher-Yates shuffle guarantees:
- Each permutation is equally likely
- O(n) time complexity
- In-place shuffling (memory efficient)
- No bias (unlike `Array.sort`)

### Random Offset Strategy
- Divides player pool into overlapping windows
- Each pack queries a different 500-player window
- Windows can overlap but rarely select same players
- Ensures even distribution across all players

### Position Balancing Algorithm
Instead of pure random selection (which favors positions with more players), we use:
```typescript
// Group fetched players by position
const playersByPosition = {
  'Quarterback': [...],
  'Running Back': [...],
  'Wide Receiver': [...],
  'Tight End': [...]
}

// For each card in pack
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // Step 1: Randomly select position (25% each)
  const position = randomChoice(['QB', 'RB', 'WR', 'TE'])
  
  // Step 2: Randomly select player from that position
  const player = randomChoice(playersByPosition[position])
  
  // Step 3: Roll rarity
  const rarity = weightedRandom(RARITY_WEIGHTS)
}
```

This ensures equal representation regardless of database composition!

### Weighted Rarity System
Uses cumulative probability:
```typescript
function rollRarity(weights) {
  const total = 100 // sum of all weights
  let random = Math.random() * total
  
  // Walk through weights
  // 0-50: common
  // 51-80: uncommon
  // 81-94: rare
  // 95-99: epic
  // 100: legendary
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. **Position-weighted packs** - Guarantee at least 1 QB per pack
2. **Themed packs** - "Rookie Pack", "Pro Bowl Pack", etc.
3. **Guaranteed rarity** - "At least 1 rare or better per pack"
4. **Team-specific packs** - "Chiefs Pack", "49ers Pack"
5. **Dynamic rarity** - Adjust odds based on player performance
