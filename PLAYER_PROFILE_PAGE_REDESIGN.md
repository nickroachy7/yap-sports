# Player Profile Page Redesign

## Overview
Created a beautifully designed, full-page player profile that matches the project's modern aesthetic with consistent header navigation, tabbed interface, and comprehensive player information.

---

## What Was Created

### âœ… New Route: `/players/[playerId]`

**Location:** `/src/app/players/[playerId]/page.tsx`

**Purpose:** Full player profile page with detailed stats, game log, and analysis

**Before:** 
- "View Full Profile" button navigated to non-existent route
- No dedicated player profile page
- Only inline player detail available

**After:**
- Full-featured player profile page
- Consistent header with navigation
- Tabbed interface for organized information
- Beautiful, modern design matching project aesthetic

---

## Features

### 1. **Consistent Header Integration** âœ…

Uses `usePageHeader` hook for unified navigation:

```typescript
usePageHeader({
  title: player?.name || 'Loading...',
  subtitle: player 
    ? `${player.position} Â· ${player.team} #${player.jersey_number} Â· ${player.stats?.total_fantasy_points.toFixed(1)} FPTS`
    : 'Player Profile',
  showNavigation: true,
  tabs: tabs,
  activeTab: activeTab,
  onTabChange: (tabId) => setActiveTab(tabId as TabType)
})
```

**Header displays:**
- Player name as title
- Position, team, jersey number, and fantasy points as subtitle
- Back/forward navigation arrows
- Four tabs: Overview, Statistics, Game Log, Analysis

### 2. **Four-Tab Interface** âœ…

#### **Overview Tab**
Comprehensive summary including:
- **Player Card** - Visual card with team colors and rarity
- **Physical Details** - Height, weight, age, college, experience, jersey number
- **Next Matchup** - Upcoming game info with opponent, date, projected points
- **Season Summary** - Key stats grid (total points, games, avg, best, worst, consistency)
- **Recent Games** - Last 5 games from game log with quick view
- **Action Buttons** - Add to Lineup, Back to Players

#### **Statistics Tab**
Detailed performance metrics:
- **Overall Performance** - Fantasy points, games played, averages
- **Position-Specific Stats** - Dynamic stats based on player position (QB, RB, WR, etc.)
- **Trend Analysis** - Last 5 games average vs season average

#### **Game Log Tab**
Complete season game-by-game breakdown:
- Full 2025 season game log
- Position-specific stat columns
- Opponent, date, score for each game
- Visual indicators for performance

#### **Analysis Tab**
Coming soon placeholder:
- Advanced analytics
- Matchup history
- Performance predictions
- Trend analysis

### 3. **Smart Data Loading** âœ…

#### Cache-First Strategy
```typescript
// Check sessionStorage cache first
const cacheKey = CACHE_KEY_PREFIX + id
const cached = sessionStorage.getItem(cacheKey)

if (cached && age < CACHE_EXPIRY) {
  // Instant load from cache!
  setPlayer(cachedData.player)
  setGameLogEntries(cachedData.gameLog)
  return
}

// Fetch fresh data if not cached
const response = await fetch(`/api/players/${id}/quick-data`)
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Instant loads for recently viewed players
- âœ… 5-minute cache expiry
- âœ… Fallback to fresh data
- âœ… Reduced API calls

### 4. **Responsive Design** âœ…

**Mobile First:**
- Single column layout on mobile
- Stacked player card and details
- Touch-friendly buttons

**Desktop Optimized:**
- Multi-column grid layouts
- Side-by-side player card and bio
- Optimized spacing and readability

**Grid Layouts:**
```typescript
// Player card + bio
grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3

// Stats summary
grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-6

// Position stats
grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4
```

### 5. **Visual Design Polish** âœ…

**Color Scheme:**
- Lime green accents for key metrics (`text-lime-400`)
- Gradient cards for emphasis
- Consistent with project palette

**Card Styles:**
- Border highlights for important sections
- Background gradients for visual depth
- Proper spacing and padding

**Typography:**
- Bold headings with icons
- Clear hierarchy
- Readable font sizes

**Example - Next Matchup:**
```tsx
<Card className="p-6 border-lime-600/50 bg-gradient-to-br from-lime-900/10 to-transparent">
  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-4 flex items-center gap-2">
    <Trophy className="w-5 h-5 text-lime-400" />
    Next Matchup
  </h3>
  {/* ... matchup details ... */}
</Card>
```

### 6. **Loading & Error States** âœ…

**Loading:**
- Skeleton screens for smooth loading experience
- Multiple skeleton blocks for different sections

**Error:**
- Friendly error message with icon
- Clear explanation
- Action button to return to players list

**Not Found:**
- Handles missing players gracefully
- Provides navigation back to safety
