# Player Modal - 2025 Season Fix ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Game Logs Showing Wrong Season/Games
**Problem**: Game log was showing both 2024 playoff games (Jan 2025) and 2025 regular season games (Sept 2025)

**Solution**: 
- Filter to ONLY 2025 regular season (August 2025 - February 2026)
- Exclude playoffs from previous season
- Sort games by week number

**Code Change** (`quick-data/route.ts`):
```typescript
// Filter to ONLY 2025 regular season games
const allStats = allStatsRaw.filter(stat => {
  const game = Array.isArray(stat.sports_event) ? stat.sports_event[0] : stat.sports_event;
  if (!game || !game.starts_at) return false;
  
  const gameDate = new Date(game.starts_at);
  const seasonStartDate = new Date(`${currentSeasonYear}-08-01`); // NFL season starts in August
  const seasonEndDate = new Date(`${currentSeasonYear + 1}-02-28`); // Ends in February next year
  
  return gameDate >= seasonStartDate && gameDate <= seasonEndDate;
});
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Only shows 2025 regular season games (Week 1-4 in Sept 2025)
- ✅ Excludes 2024 playoff games from Jan 2025
- ✅ Games sorted by week (1, 2, 3, 4)

### 2. ❌ Next Game Not Based on Current Date
**Problem**: Next game query didn't filter by current date, could show past games

**Solution**:
- Query only games after current date
- Use `gte('starts_at', currentDate)` filter

**Code Change** (`quick-data/route.ts`):
```typescript
// Get current date
const currentDate = new Date().toISOString();

// Get next upcoming game (after current date)
supabaseAdmin
  .from('sports_events')
  .select('id, home_team, away_team, starts_at, status, week_number')
  .gte('starts_at', currentDate)  // ✅ Only games after today
  .order('starts_at', { ascending: true })
  .limit(50)
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Shows correct next game: Oct 5, 2025 vs DEN (after Sept 30, 2025)
- ✅ Auto-updates based on current date

### 3. ✅ Position-Specific Stats Already Working!
**Status**: This was already implemented correctly

**Verification**:

**QB (Jalen Hurts)**:
- Season Stats: `passing_yards`, `passing_tds`, `passing_ints`, `completions`, `attempts`, `completion_pct`, `qb_rating`, `yards_per_attempt`
- Game Stats: `snp`, `cmp`, `att`, `pct`, `yds`, `ypa`, `td`, `int`, `rating`

**WR (Justin Jefferson)**:
- Season Stats: `receptions`, `receiving_yards`, `receiving_tds`, `targets`, `yards_per_reception`, `catch_pct`, `longest_reception`
- Game Stats: `snp`, `tar`, `rec`, `yds`, `ypr`, `td`, `lng`, `fum`

**RB** (if tested):
- Season Stats: `rushing_yards`, `rushing_tds`, `rushing_attempts`, `yards_per_carry`, `receptions`, `receiving_yards`, `receiving_tds`, `targets`
- Game Stats: `snp`, `car`, `yds`, `ypc`, `td`, `tar`, `rec`, `rec_yds`, `rec_td`

**TE** (if tested):
- Same as WR (receiving-focused stats)

## Test Results

### Jalen Hurts (QB) - 2025 Season
```json
{
  "season": 2025,
  "summary": {
    "total_games": 4,
    "completed_games": 4,
    "upcoming_games": 0
  },
  "next_game": {
    "opponent": "DEN",
    "date": "2025-10-05"
  },
  "all_games": [
    {"week": 1, "opponent": "DAL", "date": "2025-09-05"},
    {"week": 2, "opponent": "KC", "date": "2025-09-14"},
    {"week": 3, "opponent": "LAR", "date": "2025-09-21"},
    {"week": 4, "opponent": "TB", "date": "2025-09-28"}
  ],
  "position_stats_keys": [
    "passing_yards", "passing_tds", "passing_ints",
    "completions", "attempts", "completion_pct",
    "yards_per_attempt", "qb_rating"
  ]
}
```

### Justin Jefferson (WR) - 2025 Season
```json
{
  "position": "Wide Receiver",
  "season_stats_keys": [
    "receptions", "receiving_yards", "receiving_tds",
    "targets", "yards_per_reception", "catch_pct",
    "longest_reception"
  ],
  "game_stats_keys": [

  ]
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/app/api/players/[playerId]/quick-data/route.ts`
**Changes**:
- Added current date and season year constants
- Modified stats query to fetch all games (no date filter in DB query)
- Added filter to only include games from Aug 2025 - Feb 2026
- Modified next game query to only fetch games after current date
- Added season year and summary to response
- Sorted game log by week number

**Key Lines**:
```typescript
// Line 22-23: Current season and date
const currentSeasonYear = 2025;
const currentDate = new Date().toISOString();

// Line 70-76: Next game filter
.gte('starts_at', currentDate)

// Line 84-94: Season filter
const seasonStartDate = new Date(`${currentSeasonYear}-08-01`);
const seasonEndDate = new Date(`${currentSeasonYear + 1}-02-28`);
return gameDate >= seasonStartDate && gameDate <= seasonEndDate;

// Line 156: Sort by week
.sort((a, b) => a.week - b.week)
```

### 2. `src/components/ui/PlayerModal.tsx`
**Changes**:
- Updated cache key from `player_modal_` to `player_modal_v2_`
- This forces cache invalidation and fresh data load

**Key Line**:
```typescript
// Line 51
const CACHE_KEY_PREFIX = 'player_modal_v2_' // v2 = 2025 season only
```

---

## How to Test

### 1. Clear Browser Cache (IMPORTANT!)
**Open browser console and run**:
```javascript
// Clear old player modal cache
Object.keys(sessionStorage).forEach(key => {
  if (key.startsWith('player_modal_')) {
    sessionStorage.removeItem(key);
  }
});
```

### 2. Test QB (Jalen Hurts)
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/players
2. Search for "Hurts"
3. Click on Jalen Hurts
4. **Verify**:
   - Shows 4 games from 2025 season (Weeks 1-4, Sept 2025)
   - Next game: Oct 5, 2025 vs DEN
   - Season stats show: Passing Yards, Passing TDs, INTs, Completion %, QB Rating
   - Game log shows: CMP, ATT, YDS, TD, INT per game

### 3. Test WR (Justin Jefferson)
1. Search for "Jefferson"
2. Click on Justin Jefferson
3. **Verify**:
   - Shows 2025 season games only
   - Season stats show: Receptions, Receiving Yards, Receiving TDs, Targets, Catch %
   - Game log shows: TAR, REC, YDS, TD per game

### 4. Test Different Positions
- **RB**: Should show rushing stats (carries, rush yards, YPC) + receiving stats
- **TE**: Should show receiving stats (similar to WR)

### 5. Verify Next Game Logic
- Should always show next upcoming game after Sept 30, 2025
- For Hurts: Oct 5, 2025 vs DEN ✅
